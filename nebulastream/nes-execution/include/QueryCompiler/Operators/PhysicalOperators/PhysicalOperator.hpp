 * @brief General abstraction for all physical operators.
 * A physical operator represents the concrete realization of a logical operator.
 * It can be a direct mapping, e.g., a LogicalFilterOperator maps to a PhysicalFilterOperator.
 * Other logical operators can also result in multiple physical operators,
 * e.g., CentralWindowOperator results in a SlicePreAggregation and a WindowSinkOperator.
 * This mapping is called lowering and is defined in a PhysicalOperatorProvider.
