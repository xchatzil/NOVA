/*
 * @brief This class is being used as a container to store a probeExpression. As we do not want to limit ourselves to
 * probeExpressions in the future, we create an abstract class so that we can easily extend the functionality.
 * To receive a StatisticValue from a Statistic, we pass an object of this class and then the Statistic has to evaluate
 * the expression and return a StatisticValue. The actual implementation highly depends on the underlying Statistic.
 * For example, a Count-Min sketch can only evaluate a ArithmeticalBinaryExpressionNode with one side being a
 * ConstantValueExpressionNode and the other expression the tracked field name. A sample is a little bit more powerful
 * in terms of what expression it can expect and evaluate, as it stores all fields of the data stream.
