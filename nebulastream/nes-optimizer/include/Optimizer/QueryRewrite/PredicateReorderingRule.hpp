/**
 * @brief This rewrite rule identifies chains of adjacent predicates with various expected cardinalities.
 * The adjacent predicates are sorted and executed such that the predicates with a high selectivity are executed first.
 * This rule can reduce the size of intermediate results.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * SELECT   ve.vehicle_id, ve.model_name
 * FROM     vehicles ve,
 *          orders   od
 * WHERE    ve.vehicle_id = od.vehicle_id
 *   	   AND ve.engine_hp > 70  -- High selectivity estimated
 *          AND od.order_date > DATE(NOW() - interval 16 day)
 * GROUP BY ve.vehicle_id, ve.model_name;
 *
 *  The estimated cardinality of the predicate P1 (ve.engine_hp > 70) which selects all vehicles with at least a
 *  basic horsepower of 70 is high with an estimated selectivity of about 0.9.
 *  The estimated cardinality of the predicate P2 (od.order_date > DATE(NOW() - interval 16 day)) which limits the records
 *  fetched to the previous 15 days is low with an estimated selectivity of just 0.1.
 *  The rule will execute the predicate P1 with high selectivity first and potentially reduce the records going
 *  to the P2 significantly.
