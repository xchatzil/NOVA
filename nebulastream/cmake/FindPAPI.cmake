# Try to find PAPI headers and libraries.

#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(PAPI)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  PAPI_PREFIX         Set this variable to the root installation of
#                      libpapi if the module has problems finding the
#                      proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  PAPI_FOUND              System has PAPI libraries and headers
#  PAPI_LIBRARIES          The PAPI library
#  PAPI_INCLUDE_DIRS       The location of PAPI headers
