Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs,
    and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.We
            should forget about small efficiencies,
    say about 97
    % of the time : premature optimization is the root of all evil.Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3
    %.
