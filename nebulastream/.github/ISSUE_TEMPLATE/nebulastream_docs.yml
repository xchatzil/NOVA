        Please include links to the documentation that has the problem and possibly screenshots showing

      description: How do you think the problem can be solved?
      placeholder: >
        Please explain how you think the documentation could be fixed. Ideally specify where a new or missing
        documentation should be added and what kind of information should be included. Sometimes people
        writing the documentation do not realise that some assumptions they have might not be in the head
        of the reader, so try to explain exactly what you would like to see in the docs and why. It is ok if
        you do not know how to solve it.
